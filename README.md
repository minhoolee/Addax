Our product aims to disrupt the ad industry because we believe that 
advertisements are boring and growingly ineffective. We want to change this 
by incentivizing companies to make higher quality ads, like those seen on 
the SuperBowl. In order to do this, we artificially create an environment 
where higher quality advertisements translate into higher returns on 
investment.

In short, our product uses machine learning to score video advertisements
that companies provide, on a scale of 1-10 based off of how well the
advertisement engages the audience. This allows us to rank ads based off
of this 'impact score,' and consumers are able to view these engaging videos
under the safe assumption that they will always be provided interesting and
unique ads at all times.
